## 🚀 Projects In Progress

### 📌 1. [Review Sentiment Classifier (OpenAI-Powered NLP)](./Review-Processing)
**Goal**: Build an automated sentiment analysis tool using the `gpt-4o-mini` model to label reviews as `positive`, `neutral`, `negative`, or `irrelevant`.  
**Skills Used**:
- OpenAI API
- JSON parsing
- Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Prompt Engineering
- Data Visualization with `matplotlib`

**Highlights**:
- Created a flexible pipeline using `label.py`, `main.py`, and `visualize.py`
- Developed a custom system prompt for accuracy across human tone variance
- Used bar charts to summarize review sentiment distribution

### 📌 2. [Health Monitoring Data Processor (Wearable Tech)](./Health-Monitoring)
**Goal**: Analyze 8-hour heart-rate samples from wearable devices to identify sleep and exercise patterns.  
**Skills Used**:
- Data Cleaning with For-Loops
- Manual Statistical Calculations (avg, max, std dev, variance)
- Matplotlib Visualization
- File I/O and error handling
- Real-world simulation of a health-tech data pipeline

**Highlights**:
- Cleaned inconsistent and non-digit heart-rate values
- Built metrics without using NumPy or SciPy
- Created time-series plots of heart-rate for different activity phases
